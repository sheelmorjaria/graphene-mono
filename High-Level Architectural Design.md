High-Level Architectural Design
The system will broadly follow a Client-Server architecture with a clear distinction between the frontend, backend, and supporting services.
    1. Frontend (Client-side - Customer & Admin Interfaces):
        ◦ Technology: A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React.js, Vue.js, or Angular) to build a Single Page Application (SPA) for both the customer storefront and the Admin Dashboard. 
        ◦ Responsibilities: 
            ▪ Rendering the User Interface (UI). 
            ▪ Handling user interactions. 
            ▪ Making API calls to the backend. 
            ▪ Client-side routing. 
            ▪ Client-side validation (initial feedback to user). 
        ◦ Key Modules/Components: Product listing/details, Cart, Checkout flow, User account pages, Admin dashboard modules (Product management, Order management, etc.). 
    2. Backend (Server-side - APIs & Business Logic):
        ◦ Technology: A robust backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express.js, Python with Django/Flask, Java with Spring Boot, Go with Gin). Node.js is often a good fit for e-commerce due to its async nature and shared language with the frontend. 
        ◦ Responsibilities: 
            ▪ Exposing RESTful APIs for the frontend. 
            ▪ Implementing all core business logic (e.g., order processing, inventory updates, coupon validation, review moderation, user authentication/authorization). 
            ▪ Interacting with the database. 
            ▪ Integrating with third-party services. 
            ▪ Server-side validation and security checks. 
        ◦ Key Services/Modules (Logical Separation): 
            ▪ Authentication & User Service: Handles user registration, login, session management, password management, RBAC. 
            ▪ Product Catalog Service: Manages products, categories, inventory. 
            ▪ Order & Checkout Service: Manages cart, checkout flow, order placement, order status updates. 
            ▪ Payment & Shipping Service: Integrates with payment gateways, calculates shipping costs. 
            ▪ Admin Management Services: Specific modules for Product, Order, User, Content management. 
            ▪ Reporting & Analytics Service: Aggregates and serves KPI and report data. 
            ▪ Promotions Service: Manages coupons and discount application logic. 
            ▪ Review Service: Handles review submission, moderation, and display. 
    3. Database:
        ◦ Technology: A NoSQL database like MongoDB (given its flexibility for product catalog, user data, and order details, and its scalability features like sharding). 
        ◦ Responsibilities: 
            ▪ Persistent storage for all application data (users, products, orders, reviews, settings, content, coupons). 
        ◦ Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling (sharding) for future data growth and traffic. 
    4. External / Third-Party Services:
        ◦ Payment Gateways: PayPal, Blockonomics, GloBee (as refined in Story 13.3). 
        ◦ Email Service Provider (ESP): For transactional emails (order confirmations, password resets) and potentially marketing emails (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun). 
        ◦ Cloud Hosting Provider: (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean) for deploying the application and database. 
    5. Infrastructure & Deployment (High-Level):
        ◦ Deployment: Containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent environments across development, testing, and production. 
        ◦ Orchestration: Potentially a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) for managing containerized services, especially as the system scales (though perhaps not strictly necessary for the initial small scale). 
        ◦ CI/CD Pipeline: Automated processes for building, testing, and deploying code changes. 
        ◦ Load Balancer: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances for scalability and reliability.
