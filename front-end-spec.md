    ```
    _This diagram provides a high-level overview of the main customer-facing and admin sections of the store._

* **Navigation Structure:**
    * **Primary Navigation (Customer):** A top-level navigation bar for quick access to key sections like "Home," "Shop/Products," "Cart," and "My Account" (if logged in).
    * **Secondary Navigation (Customer):** Within product listing pages, filtering and sorting options. Within the user account, sub-navigation for "Order History" and "Profile Settings" (if applicable).
    * **Primary Navigation (Admin):** A dedicated sidebar or top bar within the Admin Dashboard for easy access to "Product Management," "Order Management," and "Sales Reports."
    * **Breadcrumbs:** To provide users with context of their location within the application, especially in deeper navigation paths.

## User Flows

Detail key user tasks. Use diagrams or descriptions.

### User Login

* **Goal:** The user wants to securely log in to their account to access personalized features or the admin dashboard.
* **Steps / Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        Start(User navigates to Login Page) --> EnterCredentials[Enter Email/Username and Password];
        EnterCredentials --> ClickLogin[Click Login Button];
        ClickLogin --> ValidateInput{Input Valid?};
        ValidateInput -- No --> ShowInputError[Display Input Validation Error];
        ValidateInput -- Yes --> SendAuthRequest[Send Authentication Request to Backend];
        SendAuthRequest --> AuthResponse{Backend Authenticates?};
        AuthResponse -- No --> ShowAuthError[Display Authentication Error Message];
        AuthResponse -- Yes --> Redirect(Redirect to Dashboard / Previous Page);
        ShowInputError --> EnterCredentials;
        ShowAuthError --> EnterCredentials;
    ```
    _This diagram illustrates the core flow for user login, including basic error handling._

### Customer Product Purchase Flow

* **Steps / Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Start: Browse Product Listing] --> B{Select Product};
        B --> C[View Product Details];
        C -- Optional --> D[Select Privacy App Installation];
        D --> E[Add to Cart];
        C -- No Installation --> E;
        E --> F{Review Cart};

## Component Library / Design System Reference

* **Approach:** We will primarily leverage **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach to styling, which will be combined with standard React components. If a specific UI component library is chosen later (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, shadcn/ui), it will be documented here.
* **Foundational Components:** Initially, we will focus on building foundational, reusable components (e.g., Button, Input, Card, Modal) that adhere to the established styling conventions and design principles. These will be created as needed following the "Template for Component Specification" outlined previously in this document.
* **Storybook / Component Showcase:** We will aim to integrate a tool like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to serve as a living documentation and component showcase. This will help maintain consistency and facilitate collaboration between design and development. The link to this showcase will be added in the "Introduction" section once available.

## Branding & Style Guide Reference

* **Link to Primary Source:** {Link to the official brand guidelines or a comprehensive style guide document, if available.}
* **Color Palette:** {Define primary, secondary, accent, and feedback colors using hex codes. E.g., Primary: `#007bff`, Secondary: `#6c757d`, Accent: `#28a745`, Error: `#dc3545`, Warning: `#ffc107`, Info: `#17a2b8`.}
* **Typography:** {Specify font families, sizes, and weights for headings (H1-H6), body text, and other textual elements. E.g., Font Family: 'Inter', Heading H1: `font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;`, Body: `font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 400;`.}
* **Iconography:** {Describe the icon set to be used (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons, custom SVG icons) and any usage notes. Link to the icon library if applicable.}
* **Spacing & Grid:** {Define a consistent spacing scale (e.g., in `rem` or `px` units) and basic grid system rules (e.g., 12-column grid, responsive breakpoints). E.g., Spacing Scale: `0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem, 3rem, 4rem, ...`. Grid System: `12-column flexible grid with 1rem gutter`.}

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements

* **Target Compliance:** We will aim to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines where applicable, ensuring a high standard of accessibility for users with disabilities.
* **Specific Requirements:**
    * **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be focusable and operable via keyboard. Focus order should be logical and intuitive.
    * **ARIA Landmarks/Attributes:** Proper use of ARIA landmarks (e.g., `role="main"`, `role="navigation"`) and attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-hidden`) for complex components and dynamic content to enhance screen reader comprehension.
    * **Color Contrast Minimums:** All text and essential graphical elements will meet minimum color contrast ratios as specified by WCAG 2.1 AA (e.g., 4.5:1 for small text, 3:1 for large text and graphical objects).
    * **Alternative Text for Images:** All meaningful images will have descriptive `alt` text. Decorative images will have empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""`).
    * **Form Labels and Instructions:** All form fields will have explicit, programmatically associated labels. Clear instructions will be provided for input formats and error handling.
    * **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus indicators will be present for all interactive elements to aid keyboard users.
    * **Dynamic Content Updates:** Changes to dynamic content (e.g., alerts, progress updates, form validation messages) will be communicated to screen reader users using ARIA live regions where appropriate.
    * **Media Accessibility:** If any audio or video content is introduced, it will include captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions as required by WCAG guidelines.

## Responsiveness

* **Breakpoints:** We will define standard breakpoints to manage responsive layouts. Typical breakpoints might include:
    * **Mobile Small:** up to 320px
    * **Mobile Large:** 321px - 480px
    * **Tablet:** 481px - 768px
    * **Desktop:** 769px - 1024px
    * **Large Desktop:** 1025px and above
    (These values can be refined based on specific design needs and common device sizes.)
* **Adaptation Strategy:**
    * **Mobile-First Approach:** Design and development will prioritize mobile layouts first, progressively enhancing for larger screens.
    * **Fluid Grids & Flexible Images:** Layouts will use fluid grids (percentages, `flexbox`, or `grid`) rather than fixed pixel widths to adapt to available space. Images will be responsive, scaling within their containers.
    * **Navigation Adaptation:** Navigation menus will adapt from full menus on desktop to collapsed (e.g., hamburger menu) patterns on smaller screens.
    * **Component Redesign:** Components may be redesigned or simplified for smaller viewports to optimize usability and reduce clutter.
    * **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** Ensure all interactive elements are appropriately sized and spaced for touch input on mobile and tablet devices.
    * **Typography Scaling:** Font sizes will scale responsively to maintain readability across different screen sizes.
