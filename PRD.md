6. Technology Stack & Constraints
This section outlines the definitive technology choices and critical constraints for the development and operation of the GrapheneOS Flashed Google Pixel E-commerce Store.
6.1. Definitive Technology Stack Selections
    • Frontend: 
        ◦ Framework: React.js (with React Hooks) 
        ◦ Build Tool: Vite 
        ◦ Styling: Tailwind CSS 
        ◦ State Management: Redux (with Redux Toolkit for crypto payment state management) 
        ◦ Language: JavaScript (ES6+ syntax) 
    • Backend: 
        ◦ Runtime: Node.js 
        ◦ Web Framework: Express.js 
        ◦ Language: JavaScript (ES6+ syntax) 
    • Database: MongoDB 
    • Object-Document Mapping (ODM): Mongoose (for Node.js/MongoDB interaction) 
    • Testing Frameworks (TDD Methodology): 
        ◦ Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library 
        ◦ Backend: Jest, Supertest 
    • Version Control: Git 
6.2. Integrations
    • Payment Gateway: 
        ◦ PayPal SDK (existing integration). 
        ◦ Bitcoin Payments: Blockonomics (for unique address generation, real-time confirmation tracking, and QR code support). 
        ◦ Monero Payments: GloBee (for completely private transactions, untraceable payment processing, and confirmation tracking). 
    • Exchange Rate API: CoinGecko API. 
    • Email Service: (e.g., SendGrid, Nodemailer) for order confirmations, password resets. 
    • Cloud Hosting: AWS (for backend services and database), Vercel (for frontend deployment). 
    • CI/CD: GitHub Actions. 
    • Analytics: Google Analytics. 
    • APM: New Relic. 
    • Error Logging: Sentry. 
    • Centralized Logging: AWS CloudWatch Logs. 
6.3. Development Constraints
    • Methodology: Strict adherence to Test-Driven Development (TDD) for both frontend and backend development. 
    • Code Quality: All code must adhere to ESLint configurations for consistent styling and error prevention. Code reviews are mandatory. 
    • Security First: All development must prioritize security, following OWASP Top 10 guidelines and implementing secure coding practices. 
    • Environment Parity: Development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible to minimize "works on my machine" issues. 
    • Documentation: Key architectural decisions, API endpoints, and complex logic must be documented. 
    • Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Frontend must be fully optimized for search engines, including appropriate meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data. 
6.4. Operational Constraints
    • Currency: All product pricing and transactions will be in GBP (£). 
    • Payment Confirmation Times: Bitcoin payments require ~30 minutes (2 confirmations), Monero payments require ~20 minutes (10 confirmations). The system must gracefully handle these asynchronous confirmations. 
    • Privacy: No private keys or sensitive wallet information related to Bitcoin or Monero will be stored within the application's database or codebase. 
    • Rate Limiting: Backend APIs must have rate limiting implemented. 
    • CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing must be configured appropriately. 
    • Order Fulfillment Model: Just-In-Time (JIT) ordering model will be supported. Order processing will be handled manually by the store administrator without direct integration with external supplier systems. 
    • Inventory Display: Inventory will be displayed simply as "In Stock" or "Out of Stock" without numerical counts. 
    • Refund Policy: Refunds will be offered for PayPal payments. For Bitcoin and Monero payments, legitimate issues (e.g., faulty product, incorrect order) will be eligible for a manual refund in GBP (via bank transfer or PayPal, as agreed with the customer). "Change of mind" returns for crypto payments may be subject to a stricter policy, clearly communicated on the website. 
7. Open Questions / To Be Determined (TBDs)
    • Exact Exchange Rate API: The CoinGecko API is chosen. The exact rate locking window (e.g., 15 minutes) and retry policy for payment will be determined during the detailed design phase. 
    • UI/UX Design Details: Specific wireframes, mockups, and detailed UX flows (especially for the enhanced payment page and crypto components) will be determined during the design phase. 

8. Conclusion (Final)
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) provides a comprehensive and finalized overview of the GrapheneOS Flashed Google Pixel E-commerce Store. It details the product's vision, clearly defines its functional and non-functional requirements, specifies the complete technology stack, and outlines the chosen integrations and operational constraints.
The project maintains a strong emphasis on security, privacy, and a seamless user experience, underpinned by a robust MERN stack architecture following TDD principles. The integration of PayPal, Bitcoin (via Blockonomics), and Monero (via GloBee) payments, managed with fixed exchange rates from CoinGecko for validity windows, addresses diverse customer preferences. The addition of a "Privacy App Installation" service expands the product offering. A dedicated admin section ensures efficient manual store and order management, supported by Google Analytics for performance tracking. The strategic use of AWS, Docker with Kubernetes, Vercel for the frontend, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD provides a scalable, maintainable, and continuously deployable foundation.
This document now serves as the definitive guiding blueprint for the development team, ensuring all stakeholders are fully aligned on the product's scope and objectives. Continuous collaboration and agile methodologies will be employed to deliver a high-quality, privacy-focused e-commerce solution.
